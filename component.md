# Component-Based Architecture in the Template

## What is a Component?
A **component** is a modular, self-contained unit of functionality that encapsulates a specific aspect of the system. Components interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, promoting reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Components
