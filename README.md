# Open Source Python Project

## Description
This repository serves as a Python project template for **CS-GY 9223 Open Source Development**, providing a structured foundation for designing and maintaining fully equipped Python projects. It includes configurations for **continuous integration (CircleCI)**, **static analysis (Ruff & Mypy)**, **code formatting**, and **dependency management using uv**.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python **3.11 or higher**
- `uv` for Python dependency management

---

## Project Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>



### **2. Navigate to the Project Directory**
```bash
cd open-source-python

### **3. Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
pip install uv


### **3. Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
pip install uv


### **4. Install Project Dependencies**
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application
To run the application, use:
```bash
python src/main.py

Replace src/main.py with the actual entry point of your project.


## Testing
To run tests, execute:
```bash
pytest --cov=src

This will run unit tests and generate a coverage report.

## Static Analysis & Code Formatting
To check and auto-fix code style and type errors, run:
```bash
ruff check src --fix
mypy src

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
This project is set up with **CircleCI**, which automatically:

- Runs tests (`pytest`)
- Checks code quality (`ruff`, `mypy`)
- Enforces code formatting and linting rules

Any new commits pushed to GitHub will trigger these checks.
